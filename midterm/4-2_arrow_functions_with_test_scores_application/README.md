# 4-2: Use Arrow Functions with the Test Scores Application
In this exercise, you’ll modify a version of the Test Scores application so it uses arrow functions instead of function expressions. This version displays the average score after each score is entered. You’ll also use an anonymous function for the DOMContentLoaded event handler. Estimated time: 10 to 15 minutes.
## Instructions
1. Run the application and add two or more scores to see that the new average is displayed each time another score is added.
2. Review the code in the JavaScript file and note that all of the functions are written as function expressions.
3. Modify the $(), addScore(), and calculateAverage() functions so they use arrow functions instead of function expressions.
4. Modify the document.addEventListener() method so it uses an anonymous function for the event handler instead of the processDOM() function.
