## 8-1: Redo a Future Value Application with jQuery
In this exercise, you’ll rewrite the code for a Future Value application that uses JavaScript so it uses jQuery. That will show you how jQuery can simplify an application, but also that JavaScript is still needed with jQuery applications. Estimated time: 10 to 15 minutes.
### Instructions
1. Add a script element to the HTML file that gives you access to the jQuery library.
2. Rewrite the code in the JavaScript file so it uses as much jQuery as possible. That includes the code for the ready() and click() event methods.
3. When you have the application working right, add jQuery code to move the focus to the Investment Amount text box each time the Calculate button is clicked.

## 8-2: Create a FAQs Rollover Application
In this exercise, you’ll write the jQuery code for an application that displays the answer to a question in a list of questions when the user hovers the mouse over that question. Estimated time: 10 to 15 minutes.
### Instructions
1. Review the HTML to see that it includes an unordered list with list items that consist of an h2 element and a \<p> element. The h2 element contains a question, and the \<p> element, which is hidden, contains the answer to the question.
2. Add jQuery code that runs when the user moves the mouse pointer into or out of a question in the list. When the mouse pointer moves into the question, the answer should be displayed. When the mouse pointer moves out of the question, the answer should be hidden.

## 9-1: Add Effect to an Image Gallery Application
In this exercise, you’ll use effects to change the way the images are displayed and hidden. Estimated time: 5 to 10 minutes.
### Instructions
1. Modify the jQuery so that when a link is clicked, the current caption and image are hidden using a sliding motion that takes two seconds.
2. Modify the jQuery so that after the caption and URL are set for the new image, that caption and image are displayed using a sliding motion that takes two seconds.

## 9-2: Debug a Slide Show Application
This Slide Show application is like the one in the book, but it has a bug in it. Instead of displaying the slides in sequence, it displays every other slide. Your task is to debug this application. Estimated time: 5 to 10 minutes if you can find the bug.
### Instructions
1. Review the HTML to see how the images for the slides are structured. Then, run the application and note that it displays every other slide. Because there are only five slides in the HTML, this means that it displays slides 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, and so on.
2. Debug this application.
