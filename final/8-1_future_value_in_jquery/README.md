# 8-1: Redo a Future Value Application with jQuery
In this exercise, youâ€™ll rewrite the code for a Future Value application that uses JavaScript so it uses jQuery. That will show you how jQuery can simplify an application, but also that JavaScript is still needed with jQuery applications. Estimated time: 10 to 15 minutes.
## Instructions
1. Add a script element to the HTML file that gives you access to the jQuery library.
2. Rewrite the code in the JavaScript file so it uses as much jQuery as possible. That includes the code for the ready() and click() event methods.
3. When you have the application working right, add jQuery code to move the focus to the Investment Amount text box each time the Calculate button is clicked.
