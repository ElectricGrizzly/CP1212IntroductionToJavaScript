# 9-2: Debug a Slide Show Application
This Slide Show application is like the one in the book, but it has a bug in it. Instead of displaying the slides in sequence, it displays every other slide. Your task is to debug this application. Estimated time: 5 to 10 minutes if you can find the bug.
## Instructions
1. Review the HTML to see how the images for the slides are structured. Then, run the application and note that it displays every other slide. Because there are only five slides in the HTML, this means that it displays slides 1, 3, 5, 2, 4, and so on.
2. Debug this application.
