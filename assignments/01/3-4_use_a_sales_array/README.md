# 3-4: Use a Sales Array
In this exercise, you’ll start with five arrays that represent sales regions, and each array contains four values that represent the quarterly sales for the region. Then, you’ll summarize the data in the page.
## Instructions
1. In the HTML file, note the link element that refers to the CSS file, and the script element refers to the JavaScript file.
2. In the JavaScript file, note that five arrays are declared with four values in each. Each of these arrays represents one sales region, and each of the values in an array represents one sales quarter. For instance, the sales for the third quarter in region 3 were 2710.
3. Write the code for summing the quarterly sales for each the five regions and displaying them on the page with the document.write() method. To do that, use an \<h2> tag for each header and a \<br> tag for a line break at the end of each line of sales data.
4. Write the code for getting and displaying the regional sales data.
5. Write the code for getting and displaying the total sales data.
