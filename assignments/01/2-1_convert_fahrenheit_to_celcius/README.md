# 2-1: Convert Fahrenheit to Celcius
In this exercise, you’ll create an application that converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius temperatures by using the prompt() method of the window object and the write() method of the document object.
## Instructions
1. Review the script element at the end of the body section and note that it’s empty. You’ll write the code for this application within this element.
2. Develop this application. Allow the user to enter decimal numbers, and display the Fahrenheit value entered by the user and the calculated Celsius value rounded to 1 digit.
