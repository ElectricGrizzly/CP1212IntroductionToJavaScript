# 3-1: Enhance the Fahrenheit to Celcius Application
In this exercise, you’ll add data validation to the application you created in extra exercise 2-1. You’ll also let the user do multiple conversions before ending the application.
## Instructions
1. Add data validation to the application so it won’t do the conversion until the user enters a Fahrenheit temperature between -100 and 212. If the entry is invalid, a dialog box like the one above should be displayed.
2. Add a loop to the code so the user can do a series of calculations without restarting the application. To end the application, the user must enter 999 as the temperature.
