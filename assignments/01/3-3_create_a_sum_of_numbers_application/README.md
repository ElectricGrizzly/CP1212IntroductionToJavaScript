# 3-3: Create a Sum of Numbers Application
This application will give you a chance to use a for loop.
## Instructions
1. In the script element, add a do-while loop that prompts the user for an entry from 1 through 100. If the entry is invalid, display an alert box with this message: “Please enter a number between 1 and 100”. Then, continue the loop until the entry is valid.
2. After the do-while loop, code a for loop that sums the numbers, and then display the second dialog box above. For instance, the sum for an entry of 4 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.
3. Add a do-while loop around all of the code that uses the second dialog box above to determine whether the first dialog box should be displayed again so the user can enter another number. The application should end for any entry other than “y”.
